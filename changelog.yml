  summary:
  date:
  fixed:
  - 'Setup works under MRI 3.0.0 (issue #622 fixed via #623) (@v-kolesnikov)'
  added:
  - "ROM(...) shortcut method for setting up rom registries (@solnic)"
  - 'You can now configure a custom inflector via configuration (PR #591) (@flash-gordon)'
  - ".transaction methods now accept keyword arguments. `Repository#transaction` accepts
    gateway to use. `Repository::Root#transaction` uses a gateway of the root relation
    by default (#620 closed by #621) (@flash-gordon)"
  - 'Backward-compatibility extension that you can load via `require "rom/compat"`
    (via #634 refs #607) (@solnic)'
  - 'New component API that replaces internal implementation of the finalization code
    and makes it possible to extend ROM with arbitrary component types (see #637)
    (@solnic)'
  - 'Generic Component API which allows you to turn any class or object into a DSL
    that can define rom components (via #650) (@solnic)'
  - 'New settings API for components using dry-configurable (via #651) (@solnic)'
  - 'Support for defining abstract components via `config.component.abstract` in which
    case they won''t be initialized for runtime usage (via #651) (@solnic)'
  - 'Ability to provide top-level component configuration ie default gateway, adapter,
    inflector etc. (via #653) (@solnic)'
  - 'Ability to configure gateways using configuration DSL (via #653) (@solnic)'
  - 'Ability to define schemas without relations (via #653) (@solnic)'
  - 'Relation view schemas that are defined via `Relation.view` DSL are now registered
    too, which makes them more accessible/reusable (via #653) (@solnic)'
  - 'Global configuration that can provide default settings for all your components.
    ie a default adapter, gateway etc. (via #654) (@solnic)'
  - 'Support for custom namespaces under which commands and mappers can be registered
    (via #654) (@solnic)'
  - "[experimental] New `ROM.components` API for registering custom component types
    (via #654) (@solnic)"
  - 'Top-level `associations` DSL (via #656) (@solnic)'

    that implementing plugins is now simpler and more powerful (via #656) (@solnic)'
  - 'New relation setting: `component.infer_id_from_class` (via #661) (@solnic)'
  changed:
  - "`rom-core`, `rom-changeset` and `rom-repository` have been merged into `rom`
    gem (@solnic)"
  - "`Schema#[]` and `Relation#[]` now raise an error if a given attribute is not
    unique (issue #529 fixed via #543) (@waiting-for-dev)"
  - 'Configuration values are no longer being frozen during setup process (issue #616
    fixed via #617) (@v-kolesnikov)'
  - "[BREAKING] `Setup#auto_registration` was renamed to `Setup#auto_register`. You
    can restore the original method via rom/compat extension (via #634 refs #607)
    (@solnic)"
  - "[BREAKING] `Configuration#method_missing` no longer resolves gateways by default.
    This functionality was moved to rom/compat (@solnic)"
  - "[internal] auto registration is now powered by Zeitwerk (via #634 refs #607)
    (@solnic)"
  - 'Plugin event listeners are no longer global which makes it possible to have plugin
    with different configs in a single process (via #639) (@solnic)'
  - "[internal] Command compiler is no longer coupled to gateway and notifications
    (via #640) (@solnic)"
  - 'Custom commands are now lazily-resolved at runtime, which simplifies and speeds
    up setup and finalization (via #641) (@solnic)'
  - 'Mappers are now lazy-resolved at runtime which speeds up setup and finalization
    (via #642) (@solnic)'
  - 'Schemas are now 1st class components accessible via runtime container and decoupled
    from relations (via #644) (@solnic)'
  - "`Relation.dataset` receives canonical schema object now, rather than relation
    class (via #644) (@solnic)"

  - 'Gateways are now lazy-loadable (via #645) (@solnic)'
  - 'Associations are now decoupled from schemas and lazy-loaded (via #646) (@solnic)'
  - 'Plugin API is now internally simplified which resulted in faster runtime. It''s
    also no longer required to register plugin types upfront (via #648) (@solnic)'
  - 'Configuring auto_register stores its config under `config.auto_register` (via
    #650) (@solnic)'
  - "[REVISIT] configuring custom gateway for a relation via DSL requires passing
    it as an option rather than specifying it within the block. It kinda-worked previously
    because the adapter was defaulting to the first one found. I'm quite sure this
    was more like a bug than a feature. This behavior could be restored in rom/compat
    though - it's a matter of defaulting to the first adapter found when gateway was
    not explicitly specified, meaning the new default should be set to `Undefined`
    rather than `:default` so that we can detect when it was not specified and act
    accordingly. This will only make sense when there's just *one adapter available*

  - "[internal] Commands that are compiled at runtime are now cached in the runtime

  - 'Plugin configurations **are no longer global** which means that you can configure
    the same plugin with different default settings for different component groups
    or different runtimes in the same Ruby process (via #654) (@solnic)'
  - "`Schema::DSL` is now deprecated. Adapters that need customized schema DSL behavior
